    "Overfitting is when the ml model learns all of the details and the noise of the training data and so performs really well on the training data, but does poorly on the testing data.  Underfitting is when an ml model performs poorly on both the test and training data. Overfitting can be avoided by holding back some of the data to be tested or by resampling.  Underfitting can be avoided by using more data or reducing features through feature selection."
